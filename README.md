**Graph condensation** (GC) is a data-centric approach that accelerates GNN model training by creating a compact yet representative graph to replace the original graph. It enables GNNs trained on the condensed graph to match the performance of those trained on the original graph.

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring various aspects of graph condensation.

For a detailed overview of graph condensation techniques and their applications, we recommend reading our survey paper: ðŸ”¥[Graph Condensation: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11720v2). This survey paper serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the fundamentals of graph condensation and exploring its diverse applications.
